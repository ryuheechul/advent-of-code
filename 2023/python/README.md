## Background

2023 is the year that I'm finally convinced and motivated to properly learn
python (so I have been) after neglecting the learning this language (properly)
for years since there was a quite a number of thing that made me apprehensive
about diving into this ecosystem until some time this year.

So I thought it would be best to pick Python as the main language for the AoC
2023 to see how comfortable I am with this lang.
