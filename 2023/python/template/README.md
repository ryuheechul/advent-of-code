Hopefully copying this directory to a new day directory makes a quicker start
with these boilerplates:

- [sample1.txt](./sample1.txt) is for the first small input (there could be
  multiple samples)
- [input.txt](./input.txt) is for the actual bigger input
- [part1.py](./part1.py) should contain the solution for part 1
- [part2.py](./part2.py) should contain the solution for part 2
