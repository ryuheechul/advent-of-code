## Background

I did make some progress in [2023](../../2023) but I didn't complete.

I'm retrying this year.

## Using Template

`./bin/gen-next.sh` will produce the next day from `./template`

## How to Run
`cd [day]` (e.g. `cd 01`) and `python -m part1` (or `part2`) should print the result value into the console
